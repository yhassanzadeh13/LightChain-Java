 * Encapsulates tests for the proposer engine.

public class ProposerEngineTest {
  // TODO: implement following test cases.
  // Mock assigner, state, snapshot, network, and storage components.
  // Create snapshot of 11 staked accounts.
  // 1. When proposer receives a new block and finds that it is the proposer of the next block, it creates a valid block
  // and sends to its assigners (i.e., 10 out of 11 nodes). The test should check that the block proposer engine creates
  // can successfully pass block validation (using a real BlockValidator).
  // 2. Same as case 1, but proposer engine does not have enough validated transactions, hence it keeps waiting till it
  // finds enough transactions in its shared pending transactions storage.
  // 3. Proposer engine throws an illegal state exception if it receives a new validated block while it
  // is pending for its previously proposed block to get validated.
  // 4. Proposer engine throws an illegal argument exception when is notified of a new validated block but cannot find
  // it on its storage (using either height or id).
  // 5. Proposer engine creates a validated block whenever it receives enough block approvals for its proposed block,
  // it also sends the validated block to all nodes including itself on the expected channel.
  // 6. Extend test case 5 for when proposer engine receives all block approvals concurrently.
