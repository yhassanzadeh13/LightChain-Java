  // TODO: a single individual test function for each of these scenarios:
  // Note: except when explicitly mentioned, always assume the input block or transaction is assigned to this node
  // i.e., mock the assigner for that.
  // 1. Happy path of receiving a valid single block.
  // 2. Happy path of receiving two valid blocks sequentially.
  // 3. Happy path of receiving two valid blocks concurrently.
  // 4. Happy path of receiving two duplicate blocks sequentially (the second duplicate block should be discarded).
  // 5. Happy path of receiving two duplicate blocks concurrently (the second duplicate block should be discarded).
  // 6. Happy path of receiving a valid block with shared transactions in pendingTx.
  // 7. Happy path of receiving an already validated block,
  //    second block should be discarded right away.
  // 8.  Unhappy path of receiving a transaction and block (sequentially) that is not assigned to this node.
  // 9.  Unhappy path of receiving a transaction and block (concurrently) that is not assigned to this node.
  // 10. Happy path of receiving a valid transaction.
  // 11. Happy path of receiving two valid transactions sequentially.
  // 12. Happy path of receiving two valid transactions concurrently.
  // 13. Happy path of receiving a duplicate pair of valid transactions sequentially.
  // 14. Happy path of receiving a duplicate pair of valid transactions concurrently.
  // 15. Happy path of receiving a transaction that already been validated (second transaction should be discarded).
  // 16. Unhappy path of receiving an entity that is neither a block nor a transaction.
  // 17. Happy path of receiving a transaction and a block concurrently (block does not contain that transaction).
  // 18. Happy path of receiving a transaction and a block concurrently (block does contain the transaction).
  // 19. Unhappy path of receiving a invalid transaction (one test per each validation criteria, e.g., correctness,
  //     soundness, etc). Invalid transaction should be discarded without sending back a signature to its sender.
  // 19. Unhappy path of receiving a invalid block (one test per each validation criteria, e.g., correctness,
  //     soundness, etc). Invalid block should be discarded without sending back a signature to its proposer.
